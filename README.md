This is a small project testing

* [Derelict3](https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3)
* [OpenGL 3+ API](http://www.opengl.org/registry/)
* Multipass post-processing effect via shaders and render-to-texture
* D builder for SCons
* SCons targets

I do *not* guarantee that this is the good way to do. You're free to improve it anyway :) Moreover, I've focused on clear understanding of what is happening, there must be faster ways to achieve this too, but it's not the purpose.

As there is no innovation here, I put codes in _Public Domain_.
